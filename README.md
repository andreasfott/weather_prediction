Course: Machine Learning (NTUA, 2024-25)

Student Name: Andreas Fotakis

Student ID: 03121100

Objective: Implementation of a machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

üìñ Project Description

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning pipeline to analyze a given dataset. The primary goal is to understand data preprocessing techniques, implement different machine learning models, and evaluate their effectiveness. The project follows a structured approach:

Data Acquisition & Cleaning

Loading the dataset into a structured format.

Handling missing values and cleaning noisy data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding feature distributions through visualizations.

Identifying patterns and correlations among variables.

Feature Engineering & Selection

Encoding categorical variables.

Selecting the most relevant features for model training.

Model Selection & Training

Comparing different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.

Fine-tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques.

Model Evaluation & Interpretation

Measuring model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Interpreting the results to derive meaningful insights from the data.
